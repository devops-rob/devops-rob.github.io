Learn how to configure a HashiCorp Vault server to help secure access to a RabbitMQ message queue in this talk for HashiTalks conference 2020.

As more software architects move their application designs towards microservice architecture and asynchronous event-driven workflows, the use of message queue systems is ever increasing. RabbitMQ is a popular choice of message queue system which is widely used globally.

Configuring applications to access such a message queue system without compromising its access credentials in the source code is a challenge that can be solved using Hashicorp Vault as a secrets management platform.
